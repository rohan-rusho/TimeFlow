TimeFlow is an Android application designed to provide quick and easy conversions between different units of time. Users can navigate through various conversion types using a bottom navigation bar.

## About The Project

TimeFlow aims to be a simple utility for users who need to convert time values, such as hours to minutes, minutes to seconds, and more complex conversions like seconds to hours or hours to days. The application's navigation structure suggests a dedicated screen or fragment for each specific conversion pair.

### Core Features (as implied by navigation)

Based on `bottom_nav_menu.xml`, the app will offer the following conversion functionalities:

*   **Hours to Minutes Conversion:** Convert a given number of hours into minutes.
*   **Minutes to Seconds Conversion:** Convert a given number of minutes into seconds.
*   **Seconds to Hours Conversion:** Convert a given number of seconds into hours.
*   **Hours to Days Conversion:** Convert a given number of hours into days.

Each of these is accessible via a distinct item in the bottom navigation bar, each with its own icon (`hour`, `min`, `sec`, `day`).

### Potential Technology Stack

While only the menu XML is provided, a typical Android application with this structure would likely use:

*   **Java or Kotlin:** As the primary programming language.
*   **Android SDK:** For building the application.
*   **Android Studio:** As the IDE.
*   **XML:** For layouts and UI definitions.
*   **Material Components for Android:** For UI elements like `BottomNavigationView`.
*   **AndroidX Libraries:** (e.g., `AppCompatActivity`, `Fragment`) for modern Android development.
